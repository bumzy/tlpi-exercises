/* Exercise 26-2: Suppose that we have three processes related as grandparent, parent, and child,
and that the grandparent doesnâ€™t immediately perform a wait() after the parent
 exits, so that the parent becomes a zombie. When do you expect the grandchild to
be adopted by init (so that getppid() in the grandchild returns 1): after the parent
terminates or after the grandparent does a wait()? Write a program to verify your
answer. */
